A short-term database solution that can store the full data for the past 24 hours
A long-term archive solution for data older than 24 hours
Some form of visualisation for the data

## Notes:

Number of plants can and will change / ID’s aren’t guaranteed to be accurate.
Get given a basic schema.
Coaches will act as stakeholders.
OOP and TDD - not mandatory but recommended.
Botanists to Plants - one-to-many.
Raspberry Pi’s - limited linux operations.
Visualisation required - should probably make a dashboard although not necessary.
