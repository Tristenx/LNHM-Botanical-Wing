# Plant Health Monitor
This plant monitoring system, developed for the Liverpool Natural History Museum, enables the museum to alert 
gardeners whenever issues arise. Data older than 24 hours is summarized and moved from short-term to long-term storage.

## Description
The health of each plant is monitored by a Raspberry Pi which measures various environmental factors that affect 
plant growth. The data gathered by this hardware is updated every minute and exposed via an API endpoint.
